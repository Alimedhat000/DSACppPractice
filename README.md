## Introduction
This repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms that I have implemented while practicing my C++ skills. Each implementation is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to understand. The goal of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of essential computer science concepts and to provide a resource for others learning these topics.

## Implemented Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Dynamic arrays with basic operations like insert, delete, resize, etc.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks**: LIFO structure with operations such as push, pop, peek.
- **Queues**: FIFO structure with implementations of regular and circular queues.
- **Hashmaps**: Simple hash table implementation with collision handling.
- **Trees**: Binary Search Trees, AVL trees, etc.
- **Heaps**: Max and Min heaps with heapify, insertion, and deletion.
- **Graphs**: Adjacency list and matrix-based representations of graphs.

## Implemented Algorithms
- **Sorting**: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, and more.
- **Searching**: Binary search, linear search, and graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra's shortest path, Kruskal's and Prim's MST algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to classic problems like the Knapsack Problem, Fibonacci, and more.
- **Backtracking**: N-Queens problem, solving mazes, etc.
